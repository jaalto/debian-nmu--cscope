Description: Interactively examine a C program source
 Cscope is an interactive text screen based source browsing tool.
 Although it is primarily designed to search C code (including lex
 and yacc files), it can also be used for C++ code.
 .
 Using cscope, you can easily search for where symbols are used and
 defined.  Cscope is designed to answer questions like:
 .
 Where is this variable used?
 What is the value of this preprocessor symbol?
 Where is this function in the source files?
 What functions call this function?
 What functions are called by this function?
 Where does the message "out of space" come from?
 Where is this source file in the directory structure?
 What files include this header file?
