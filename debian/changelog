        * src/dir.c (makefilelist): Fix broken movement of point_in_line
          when parsing quoted names.  Simplify structure by moving default
          handling upward.

                            cscope.files
     - 2004-12-06  Neil Horman  <nhorman@gmail.com>

    so that disabling of fuzzy matching would work correctly.

  * Updated Standards-Version: from to 3.6.2.
  * Updated author list in debian/copyright.
